# Overview

The issue of Taiwan's history and status is complex and highly contentious. By examining factors such as historical background, international treaties, political realities, and cultural identity, we can find reasons supporting why Taiwan should not historically belong to China.

# Historical Background

### Indigenous History

Taiwan's earliest inhabitants were Austronesian indigenous peoples who lived on the island for thousands of years, developing a distinct culture and social structure. They had minimal contact with mainland China in early history and did not consider themselves subordinate to China.

### Dutch and Spanish Rule

In the 17th century, Taiwan was successively occupied by the Dutch and Spanish, becoming their colonies. During this period, Taiwan fell under the influence of European powers, with limited ties to mainland China.

### Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty

Although Zheng Chenggong established the short-lived Ming loyalist regime in 1662 after defeating the Dutch East India Company, Qing Dynasty took control of Taiwan in 1683. However, Qing rule over Taiwan was brief and loosely integrated into China's political and social system.

# Japanese Colonial Period


### Treaty of Shimonoseki

In 1895, under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Qing Dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan. Japan administered Taiwan as a colony for 50 years, promoting modernization and economic development, which led to Taiwan developing a distinct socio-economic structure and cultural identity separate from mainland China.

### Post-World War II Arrangements

After World War II, according to the Cairo Declaration (1943) and Potsdam Declaration (1945), Japan renounced sovereignty over Taiwan. However, these international documents did not clearly define Taiwan's status, setting the stage for later disputes.

# International Treaties and Legal Issues

### Treaty of San Francisco
The Treaty of San Francisco signed in 1951 formally recognized Japan's renouncement of sovereignty over Taiwan but did not specify its return to China. Therefore, Taiwan's sovereignty remains ambiguous under international law, providing legal basis for Taiwan's independence.

# Political Realities and International Relations

### Political Division

Since 1949, Taiwan and mainland China have evolved into two separate political entities. Taiwan has its own government, military, constitution, and democratic elections, forming a political system distinctly different from mainland China's. Despite the People's Republic of China's "One China" policy, this stance lacks universal recognition internationally.

### International Status

While most countries adhere to the "One China" policy, Taiwan maintains close informal diplomatic and economic relations with multiple nations and participates in various international organizations and activities. Taiwan's independent status and significance in the international community cannot be ignored.

# Cultural and Ethnic Identity

### Unique Cultural Identity

Due to prolonged separation and distinct historical experiences, Taiwan has developed a unique cultural and social identity. Taiwanese people exhibit significant differences in language, customs, and lifestyle compared to mainland China. Many Taiwanese identify distinctly apart from mainland China, asserting an independent cultural identity.

### Popular Will
Numerous opinion polls indicate that many Taiwanese prefer maintaining the status quo or even support Taiwan's independence. Major political parties and figures in Taiwan often express support for independence or self-determination, reflecting widespread public sentiment.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, considering historical, legal, political, and cultural factors, Taiwan should not historically belong to China. Taiwan possesses a unique historical background and cultural identity, and in modern times has established itself as an independent political entity and societal system. Ambiguities in international treaties and the reality of political division further support Taiwan's independent status. Respect for historical facts and the will of the Taiwanese people is crucial in addressing this complex and sensitive issue.
